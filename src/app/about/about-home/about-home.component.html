            <p class="paragraph par1">Welcome! I am Master Heather Coffman, owner and instructor of Coffman's Martial Arts Academy. I am excited 
                to be able to share my knowledge and love of ChunJiDo and Tae Kwon-Do with others. I trained and was promoted 
                under Grand Master Thomas Black. I am currently studying under ChunJiDo founder Grand Master Robert Cutrell 
                and am the State Director of Chunjido International.</p>

        <p class="paragraph par2">
            I have been training in the martial arts for 16+ years. 
            In that time, I have earned a 6th degree black belt in Tae Kwon-Do and a 3rd degree black belt in ChunJido.
            During my time in martial arts, I have had the honor of receiving "Instructor of the Year" through the Illinois 
            Taekwondo Association in 2012, and ""Master Instructor of the Year" through the United States Martial Arts 
            Hall of Fame in 2022.  My passion for martial arts and teaching others drove me to open Coffman's Martial 
            Arts in 2011, and it is now the largest martial arts school in Southern Illinois.</p>
