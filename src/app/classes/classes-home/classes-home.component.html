        <h2>Tae Kwon-Do</h2>
        Artists know when to walk away and when to stand firm and protect themselves and their loved 
        ones. Every movement of Tae Kwon Do is scientifically designed with a specific purpose. Constant 
        Repetition teaches patience and how to overcome any difficulty. The tremendous power generated 
        from oneâ€™s body develops the self-confidence to face any opponent, at any place, and in any 
        situation. Sparring teaches humility, courage, alertness, accuracy and adaptability as well 
        as self-control. Forms teach flexibility, grace, balance, and coordination, while the fundamental 
        exercises develop preciseness and teach method, principle and purpose. Eventually, this training 
        permeates every conscious and subconscious action of the student. Thus, Tae Kwon-Do offers a 
        strict self-imposed discipline along with the spirit of cooperation and mutual respect among 
        other students. Classes are offered to students starting at age 6.
